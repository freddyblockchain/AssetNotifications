## Project Description

NFTLottery is a lottery, where algorand wallets can participate, to have a chance at winning an algorand asset.
There are 5 smart contract methods that can be called by anyone. These are:

- startLottery
- participate
- resolveLottery
- claimWin
- resetLottery

Each participant is given a number when participating, and when the lottery is resolved (meaning a winning number has been found), then the winning participant can claim an asset, and the lottery is done.
Each lottery can be reset after a set number of rounds, to account for a participant never claiming their reward.

## Project Architecture

The project is composed of a smart contract, that has the lottery logic, and a front end application, that simulates
a lottery. The randomness used in the smart contract is retrieved from the randomness smart contract, currently living
on the testnet (App id : 110096026).

## How to use

During any of these steps, if calling the smart contract fails, an alert will pop up.
This happens if the lottery is in a state, that does not allow the pressed action.

- Go to https://freddyblockchain.github.io/Lottery-App/
- Press Start Lottery.
- press "Participate" on the test accounts present below. The accounts will now get a participant number and participant round
- Wait until the "Current Round" exceeds the "Lottery Round". Both are present on the bottom of the page.
- Press "Resolve Lottery". After some seconds, "Winning Round" will now have a number between 1 and the number of participants.
- Press "Claim Win" on the participant, whose participant number matches the winning number.
- After some seconds, an alert pops up saying you won the NFT, and the participant gets its asset number incremented, and the lottery is done.
- The whole process can now be repeated.

## Demo

## Roadmap

- Create off-chain lookup table, that could automate the process of sending the NFT to the winner.
- Create wallet integration, that would let any wallet access the lottery, from the front-end application.
